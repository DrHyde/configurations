This is going to be just a bunch of config files for various
tools that I might want to have easy access to from all over
the place.  It is probably of no interest whatsoever to you.

To use it ...

```
git clone git@github.com:DrHyde/configurations.git
configurations/install.sh
```

You might have to twiddle the URL to https://github.com/DrHyde/configurations.git if you're not me,
and the contents of `.envrc` will be wrong for you too.
